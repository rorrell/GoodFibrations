# GoodFibrations
This was a PHP + MySQL website I did as a freelance project.  Unfortunately, 7 years and who knows how many computers after termination of the project (due to the client company going out of business), I cannot find the original source code.  I did, however, find the website on an internet archive, so I'll commit what I can from that.
