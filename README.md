# GoodFibrations
This was a PHP + MySQL website I did as a freelance project.  Unfortunately, 7 years and who knows how many computers after termination of the project (due to the client company going out of business), I cannot find the original source code.  I did, however, find the website on an internet [archive] (http://web.archive.org/web/20071210171209/http://www.goodfibrations.net/index.php), so I'll commit a screeshot from that to start off with.

The purpose of this is really just an *"I'm not making this up."*
